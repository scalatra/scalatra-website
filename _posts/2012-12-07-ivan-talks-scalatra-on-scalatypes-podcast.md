One of Scalatra's core developers, 
[Ivan Porto Carrero](http://twitter.com/casualjim), showed up on this week's
[Scalatypes](http://scalatypes.com/episode-24-ivan-porto-carrero-on-scalatra-and-json4s) podcast, as the featured interviewee.

In the hour-long podcast, Ivan is interviewed by [Yuvi Masory](http://twitter.com/ymasory). The conversation is a solid introduction to Scalatra:
the philosophy behind the code, its current feature set, and a
quick look at upcoming developments in Scalatra 2.3 and 3.0.

A set of slides from the talk is also available 
[on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/casualjim/scalatra-22).
