Just in time for the end of the year, we're nearly done with the 
Big Documentation Push of 2012. This time we've got a full guide to 
Scalatra's new [Atmosphere](http://scalatra.org/2.2/guides/atmosphere.html)
support. 

The [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere) integration is an
exciting addition to the upcoming Scalatra 2.2 release. It provides server-push 
capabilities for persistently connected clients, and takes care of the low-level
connection and transport details using its own JavaScript
[connector library](https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/jQuery.atmosphere.js-API).

In other news, after quite a bit of discussion over the exact meaning of
the word "databinding", the namespace formerly known as "databinding"
has been renamed to "commands". We've updated the
[Scalatra Guides](http://scalatra.org/2.2/guides) to reflect the new
name. The example application has been updated and should work as before. 

There are several other areas of the docs we'll be targeting over the next
few weeks - [Models](http://scalatra.org/guides/models.html), and I18N,
we're looking at you!
