Scalatra 2.2 has been in development for about the past two months. As the release is nearly completed, the project has cut a release candidate, Scalatra 2.2.0-RC1. 

Here's a quick rundown of what's changed since 2.1.1, the current stable release. Some new (but incomplete) documentation for this release candidate is also available, at [http://scalatra.org/2.2/guides/](http://scalatra.org/2.2/guides/)

Testing, bug reports, and feedback are all very welcome. 

### Global

* Removes jerkson support
* Removes anti-xml support
* Adds Jackson support
* Adds common traits for pluggable json serialization. These traits allow library writers to write against a generic json interface. The application developer can then mix in a specific json implementation, such as lift-json or jackson, and retain all functionality
* Defers reading request parameters until the last responsible moment (aka lazify)
* Contrib project has been removed. All the contrib modules have been moved into the main Scalatra project

### Core
* Adds typed param support, previously in contrib
* `ApiFormats` now also has a method `responseFormat` which looks at the content type of the response and falls back to the format of the request.
* The default bootstrap file is renamed from `Scalatra` to `ScalatraBootstrap`
* `FileUpload` can now be configured through init parameters
* RouteMatchers don't use any by-name params anymore
* `RouteMatcher` now takes a `requestPath` as a param to the `apply` method
* You are able to mount the same servlet more than once in the `ScalatraBootstrap` class
* Added a new `relativeUrl` method which will compose a path for redirection and keep relative paths relative
* Refactored the `url` method to allow for a more granular building of the path with regards to the context path and servlet path
* Added a `fullUrl` method which will use the absolute path created by the `url` method to build a url with protocol, host, port and path + querystring
* Added a `isHttps` method which also looks in the headers for a `X-Forwarded-Proto` header
* Added a `needsHttps` method which looks in the init params for a key `org.scalatra.ForceHttps` for a boolean value (true/false), this is used by the `fullUrl` method to work out the protocol
* Added a `org.scalatra.HostName` init parameter in which you can override the host name of this scalatra application, if unset the value from `request.getServerName` will be used
* Added a `org.scalatra.Port` init parameter in which you can override the port of this scalatra application, if unset the value from `request.getServerPort` will be used
* ApiFormats now also has a reverse mapping for the txt extension

### lift-json
* removed in favour of json4s support

### Jackson
* removed in favour of json4s support

### JSON
* previous lift-json support is replaced with json4s support.
* Jackson integration is also provided through json4s
* Replaces ProductToJsonSupport trait with a `JValueResult` trait which will try to serialize any value to json or xml
  when the accept headers or format parameter indicate the user wants json or xml.

### Scalate
* Adds ScalateRenderSupport trait taken from contrib

### Databinding
* Adds a databinding module for commands.
  The commands can have validations attached and will read data from headers, params and the request body (like json/xml)
  This is implemented using an infrastructure of type classes and uses scalaz validations to capture the validation information.

```scala
        class RegisterForm extends JacksonCommand { // you have to pick the json library of choice

          val login: Field[String] = asString("login").required.notBlank.minLength(6).validForFormat("\\w+".r)

          val name: Field[String] = asString("name")

          val email: Field[String] = asString("email").required.notBlank.validEmail

          val homepage: Field[String] = asString("homepage").validUrl

          val passwordConfirmation: FieldBinding = asString("passwordConfirmation").required.notBlank

          val password: FieldBinding = asString("password").required.notBlank.validConfirmation("passwordConfirmation", passwordConfirmation.value)

        }
```

### Atmosphere
* Adds an atmosphere integration. This module adds support for websockets, long-polling, and server-side events.

```scala

        class MyAtmoServlet {
          def receive = {
            case Connected =>
            case Disconnected(disconnector, Some(error)) =>
            case Error(Some(error)) =>
            case TextMessage(text) => send("ECHO: " + text)
            case JsonMessage(json) => broadcast(json)
          }
        }
```

### Swagger
* Added serialization for AllowableValues in `Swagger.scala`.  These are passed as strings in the AllowableValues object:

```scala
  // as List
  allowableValues = AllowableValues(1, 2, 3)
  
  // as range
  allowableValues = AllowableValues(0 to 1000)
```

* Updated to support the [swagger-1.1 spec](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki/API-Declaration)
* Allows for using either jackson or native json to generate the service description json
* Auto-registers servlets and filters that extend the SwaggerSupport trait in the swagger manager.
* Includes the swagger-core and swagger-annotations jars as transitive dependencies (batteries included)
* the models property in the `SwaggerSupport` can now be Set as `Map(classOf[Pet])`
* responseClass can now be set with a type parameter `responseClass[Pet]`
* data types in `Parameter` and `ModelField` definitions can now be defined as `DataType[List[String]]`

### Swagger-Ext

* Adds support for authorization through scentry to Swagger.  Shows only actions a user is allowed to see.
  [Example](https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra/blob/develop/swagger-ext/src/test/scala/org/scalatra/swagger/SwaggerAuthSpec.scala)
* Adds support for using commands with Swagger. This creates a model definition for the body parameters and parameter
  definitions for the query, path and header params as well as a parameter for the body model

```scala
  // So your route looks like this:
  get("/id", endpoint("id"), nickname("getById"), parameters[MyCommand])

  // MyCommand is a databinder which takes care of automatic 
  // validation and binding of incoming params, and also allows 
  // Swagger params annotations to be automatically inferred from 
  // the MyCommand params.  
  class MyCommand extends JsonCommand {
    protected implicit val jsonFormats: Formats = DefaultFormats
    
    val name: Field[String] = asString("name").notBlank

    val age: Field[Int] = "age"

    val token: Field[String] = (
        asString("API-TOKEN").notBlank
          sourcedFrom ValueSource.Header 
          description "The API token for this request"
          notes "Invalid data kills cute innocent kittens"
          allowableValues "123")

    val skip: Field[Int] = asInt("skip").sourcedFrom(ValueSource.Query).description("The offset for this collection index")
    
    val limit: Field[Int] = asType[Int]("limit").sourcedFrom(ValueSource.Query).withDefaultValue(20).description("the max number of items to return")
  }
```

### Testing
* Added a method `ensureSessionIsSerializable` method which will try to serialize every session value.

### Auth
* Scentry is now lazily initialized so the order of the traits doesn't matter anymore
