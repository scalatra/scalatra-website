Many thanks to [Jos Dirksen](https://twitter.com/josdirksen) of
[smartjava.org](http://smartjava.org), who has been working on a series of
Scalatra tutorials. The [first part](http://www.smartjava.org/content/tutorial-getting-started-scala-and-scalatra-part-i)
offers a very quick intro to Scalatra and some tips on Eclipse integration.

The [second part](http://www.smartjava.org/content/tutorial-getting-started-scala-and-scalatra-part-ii) gives an overview of an embedded Jetty setup, and then moves
into RESTful API construction techniques using case classes and JSON. The tutorial
finishes off with an introduction to Scalatra testing using the Specs2 testing
framework, including Eclipse configs for test runners.
