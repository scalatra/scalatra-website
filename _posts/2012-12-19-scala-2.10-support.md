For any early adopters of Scala 2.10, a port of Scalatra to Scala 2.10
is available in snapshot form.  To try it,

1) Bump your Scala version:

    scalaVersion := "2.10.0-RC5"

2) Add the resolver

    resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

3) Use the sbt cross-build convention (adds the _2.10 suffix to the
artifact ID):

    "org.scalatra" % "scalatra" % "2.2.0-SNAPSHOT" cross CrossVersion.binary,

This port contains minimal changes from the master branch to make it
work on the new version of Scala. It is intended as a drop-in
replacement to ease your eventual upgrade to Scala 2.10. Future
versions of Scalatra will utilize Scala 2.10's new features, but the
primary goal for this release is compatibility.

There is no RC because some of our dependencies have not been formally
released for Scala 2.10.  We hope to have a tagged build against Scala
2.10.0-final soon after it is released, currently expected December
26.
