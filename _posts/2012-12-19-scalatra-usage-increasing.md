In preparation for the 2.2.0 final release, [Yuvi Masory](http://yuvimasory.com/) has been cranking out all kinds of reference material:

* [Fast code reloading with JRebel](http://scalatra.org/2.2/getting-started/jrebel.html)
* [Deploying to Jelastic](http://scalatra.org/2.2/getting-started/jelastic.html)
* [Deploying to Heroku](http://scalatra.org/2.2/getting-started/heroku.html)
* [Deploying to Google App Engine](http://scalatra.org/2.2/getting-started/google-app-engine.html)

This will hopefully make it much easier for people to get started with Scalatra, and to become productive quickly.

In other news, the number of users of the Scalatra framework seems to be increasing steadily.

[Joe Crobak](http://twitter.com/joecrobak), [Joe Ennever](http://twitter.com/TDJoe), and [Matthew Rathbone](http://twitter.com/rathboma) over at FourSquare [have open-sourced an internal tool](http://engineering.foursquare.com/2012/10/16/open-sourcing-our-dashboard-for-apache-oozie/) for managing [Apache Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) workflows, and called it [Oozie Web](https://github.com/foursquare/oozie-web).

Meanwhile, ≈Åukasz Lenart from [softwaremill.com](http://softwaremill.com/) has [released a project](http://softwaremill.com/bootstrap-goes-open-source) called the [SoftwareMill Bootstrap](https://github.com/softwaremill/bootstrap), to provide a quick way of getting Scalatra + [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) projects up and running quickly.

Lastly, [Jesper Hammarback](http://twitter.com/hammarback) has just release [PaintFeud](http://www.paintfeud.com), a realtime iPhone game built using Titanium, uses Scalatra as a back-end, and involves CQRS, eventsourcing, Actors, and MongoDB.
