# Built With Scalatra

## Production Systems

### LinkedIn Signal

[LinkedIn Signal](http://sna-projects.com/blog/2010/10/linkedin-signal-a-look-under-the-hood/) is using it in their backend.

### Chacha

[ChaCha](http://www.chacha.com/) is using it in multiple internal applications.

### The Guardian

Scalatra is used in a number of systems that help power [The Guardian](http:///www.guardian.co.uk/), for instance the [music artist pages](http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2011/jun/23/internet).

## Open Source Projects

### Bowler Framework

[Bowler](http://bowlerframework.org) is a RESTful, multi-channel ready web framework in Scala with a functional flavour, built on top of Scalatra and Scalate, with Lift-JSON doing the heavy JSON lifting. The project is built with Simple Build Tool ("sbt")- we intend to further add custom sbt processors in the future to automate boilerplate tasks.

### Fink

[Fink](https://github.com/dozed/fink) is a Scalatra based CMS.
