## Generate a Scalatra project

Now that [installation](installation.html) is out of the way, you can
generate a project:

```bash
g8 scalatra/scalatra-sbt
```

This will check out a pre-built application skeleton for you (from [Github](https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra-sbt.g8)),
and ask you some questions about your application:

```
$ g8 scalatra/scalatra-sbt
organization [com.example]:
package [com.example.app]:
name [My Scalatra Web App]:
servlet_name [MyScalatraServlet]:
scala_version [2.9.2]:
version [0.1.0-SNAPSHOT]:
```

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>organization</dt>
  <dd>
    Used for publishing.
    Should be the reverse of a domain name you control.
    If you don't own a domain, <code>com.github.username</code> is a popular choice.
  </dd>
  <dt>package</dt>
  <dd>
    All Scala code belongs in a package.
    The <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html#packages">Scala Style Guide<a> recommends that your packages start with your organization.
    This convention is used across multiple JVM languages and gives your
    project a globally unique namespace.
  </dd>
  <dt>name</dt>
  <dd>
    The name of your project.
    g8 will generate a project into a folder of that name, and the artifacts
    you publish will be based on that name.
  </dd>
  <dt>servlet_name</dt>
  <dd>
    The name of your servlet class.
    This might be something like <code>BlogServlet</code> or just <code>Blog</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>version</dt>
  <dt>scala_version</dt>
  <dd>
    The Scala version to use.
    The bottom of the <a href="http://www.scalatra.org/2.2/">homepage</a> lists which Scala versions are compatible with the latest Scalatra releases.
    When in doubt, use the default.
  </dd>
  <dd>
    Your project's version.
    This is entirely up to you, but we like
    <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning</a>.
  </dd>
</dl>

## Building

Scala is a compiled language, so you need to build your Scalatra project.

Enter your application's top-level directory, set `sbt` to executable, type `./sbt`, and the
application will build.
For example:

```bash
$ cd /your/project/directory
$ chmod u+x sbt
$ ./sbt
```

sbt will also take care of downloading an entire Scalatra development
environment if you don't have one yet.
That means sbt may spend some time downloading Scalatra and its libraries
on first run.

## Hello world

Now that Scalatra is now installed, how about making your first application?
Source files go into `src/main/scala/com/example/app`
(substitute your package for `com/example/app`).
Open `src/main/scala/com/example/app/MyScalatraServlet.scala`, or whatever
you named your servlet when you generated your project with g8:

```scala
package com.example.app

import org.scalatra._
import scalate.ScalateSupport

class MyServlet extends ScalatraServlet with ScalateSupport {

  get("/") {
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        Say <a href="hello-scalate">hello to Scalate</a>.
      </body>
    </html>
  }
}
```

If you haven't already done so, from your project root, you can run the
project:

```bash
$ ./sbt
> container:start
```

The application starts on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <span class="badge badge-info"><i class="icon-flag icon-white"></i></span>
  As you can see, Scalatra doesn't force you to setup much infrastructure: a
  request to a URL evaluates some Scala code and returns some text in
  response.
  Whatever the block returns is sent back to the browser.
</div>

Scalatra allows you to return strongly-typed results from any of its actions.
The action above returns an XML literal - you could easily change it to
return a string by altering the action:

```scala
get("/") {
  "Hi there!"
}
```

Returning a raw string is not something you'll do particularly often -
usually you will want to return formatted HTML that is the product of a
templating system, or an output format like JSON.
See the [views](../guides/views.html) and [helpers](../guides/helpers.html)
sections of our [guides](../guides) for more info.

## Automatic code reloading

Restarting an application manually after every code change is both slow and
painful.
It can easily be avoided by using a tool for automatic code reloading.

sbt will allow you to [signal a restart of the application when it detects
code changes](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Triggered-Execution).
The syntax for restarting involves adding `~` in front of the command you
want to re-execute.
To recompile and reload your application automatically, run the following:

```bash
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> ~ ;copy-resources;aux-compile
```

Now that you've got a (rather simplistic) running application, you may want
to [understand more](understanding-scalatra.html) about the project setup, or
dive straight into our [guides](../guides), which show you how to perform
common development tasks.

Alternately, you may want to look at some example applications.

## Scalatra examples

For most people, the easiest way to learn a new web framework is to see
example code in action.

The Scalatra code base contains [examples][examples] which you can easily run
yourself.
These are a great opportunity to dissect some code for common tasks,
including:

[examples]: https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra/tree/develop/example/src/main/scala/org/scalatra

* parameters
* form submission
* file uploading
* flash scope
* login / logout actions
* filters
* cookies
* chat (Atmosphere-based Meteor chat)
* chat (Servlet 3.0-based async chat)

Download and run the examples:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra.git
$ cd scalatra
$ ./sbt
> project scalatra-example
> container:start
```

There should now be a website with examples running at
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
(Just make sure you're not already running your own project on that port!).

The code running the examples site resides in
```example/src/main/scala/org/scalatra/```.

Now that you've created your first Scalatra app, it's time to learn a little
bit about Scalatra's simple [project structure](understanding-scalatra.html).
