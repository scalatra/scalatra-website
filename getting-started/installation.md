  <h1>Installation</h1>
</div>

Getting started with a new web framework can be a bit scary. Luckily, Scalatra
is easy to install, as it has relatively few dependencies.

It can run on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, or BSD.

## 1. Install a JDK

Scalatra is web micro-framework written in Scala, so you'll need to have a
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Many systems will already include
a JDK.

Run `java -version` and `javac -version` in a terminal to find if yours
does. The output should look something like this:

```
$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_24"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.11.1) (6b24-1.11.1-3)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.0-b12, mixed mode)
```

```
$ javac -version
javac 1.7.0_03
```

You need at least version 1.6.

If you don't yet have Java installed, you can find out how to install
it for your system
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/index.html">
over at the Java 7 install page</a>. Make sure you've got Open JDK or Sun JDK,
as <code>gcj</code>, which is pre-installed on some Linux distros, won't work.

## 2. Install sbt, conscript, and giter8

Once you're sure you've got Java installed, you need to download a few other
utilities.

[Conscript](https://github.com/n8han/conscript) is a tool for installing and
updating Scala code. [Giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8/), which depends
on conscript, allows you to check out project templates directly from Github.
It's the recommended way to generate Scalatra project skeletons.

Lastly, you'll need [sbt](http://scala-sbt.org), the Simple Build Tool. This is
a Scala program which will automatically download everything your Scalatra project
needs, and build it.

You can either use install packages for your system (using the TypeSafe Stack) or
install them manually.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="myTab">
  <li class="active"><a href="#stack" data-toggle="tab">Install the TypeSafe Stack</a></li>
  <li><a href="#manual" data-toggle="tab">Install Manually</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane active" id="stack">
  	<p>TypeSafe is a Scala consulting company which maintains both the Scala language itself
  	and quite a few of its associated tools. They offer easy-to-install packages for
  	most systems: Windows, Mac OS X (via homebrew), Debian/Ubuntu, and Red Hat Linux.</p>

  	<p>The TypeSafe Stack includes everything you'll need to get started with Scalatra, including
  		<code>sbt</code>, <code>conscript</code>, and <code>giter8</code>.</p>
  	<p>To install it, <a href="http://typesafe.com/stack/download">go to the
        Typesafe downloads page</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-pane" id="manual">

  	<p>If you'd rather install things yourself, it's still a very easy process.</p>

<h4>Install conscript and giterate</h4>

  	<p>To install conscript, issue this command in your terminal:</p>

  	<pre>curl https://raw.github.com/n8han/conscript/master/setup.sh | sh</pre>

  	<p>This will create a _bin_ folder in your home directory.  Put that on your
  	path, by adding the following to your shell's profile (e.g. <code>~/.bash_profile)</code>:</p>

  	<pre>PATH=$PATH:~/bin
export path</pre>

  	<p>Make sure you reload your shell:</p>

  	<pre>source ~/.bash_profile</pre>


  	<p>Now you can use conscript to install Giter8:</p>

  	<pre>cs n8han/giter8</pre>

  	<p>Depending on your connection speed, this can take a bit of time, as `conscript`
  	downloads quite a few Scala dependencies.</p>

  	<h4>Install SBT</h4>

  	<p>The last thing you'll need is `sbt`, the Simple Build Tool.</p>

  	<p>You can download <code>sbt</code> at the
  		<a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html">SBT website</a>.</p>

That's it! You've now got everything you need.

You might want to set up your IDE. If you're using Eclipse, you can use the [sbt-eclipse](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse) plugin. This gets sbt dependencies set up on the Eclipse classpath, so that your project works as expected in the IDE. Similar functionality for IntelliJ IDEA is provided by the [sbt-idea](https://github.com/mpeltonen/sbt-idea) plugin. Make sure the you run "sbt eclipse" or "sbt idea" every time you [add or update a dependency](understanding-scalatra.html) in build.sbt.

Head over to the "[first steps](first-steps.html)" page, which will tell you how to generate,
build, and run a Scalatra application.
