### 1. Start small, build upwards

Start with a small core, and have lots of easy integrations for common tasks.

### 2. Freedom

Allow the user freedom to choose whatever structure and libraries make the most sense for the application being built.

### 3. Solid, but not stolid


Use solid base components. For instance, servlets aren't cool, but they are
extremely stable and have a huge community behind them. At the same time, work
to advance the state of web application development by using new techniques
and approaches.

### 4. Love HTTP

Embrace HTTP and its stateless nature. People get into trouble when they fool themselves into thinking things which aren't true - fancy server-side tricks to give an illusion of statefulness aren't for us.
