The Scalatra team is pleased to announce the release of version 2.8.0 of the framework.

Here's the list of major changes for version 2.8.0:

* Update dependent libraries
* Deprecate scalatra-atmosphere and scalatra-scalate
* Drop Scala 2.11 support

This version is a step of migrating Scalatra to Scala 3. Deprecated features will be dropped in Scalatra 2.9.0 and Scalatra will be Scala3 compatible in Scalatra 3.0.0.
