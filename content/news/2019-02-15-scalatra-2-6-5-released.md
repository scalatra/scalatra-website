The Scalatra team is pleased to announce the release of version 2.6.5 of the framework. 

<!--more-->

Here's the full list of changes from version 2.6.4:

### Modules

* Upgrade Json4s 3.6.3
* Date & Time support for Swagger

We have a plan to move [http4s](https://github.com/http4s/http4s) in Scalatra 3.0.0. We will continue to maintain Scalatra 2.x systems, but we will deprecate unnecessary functions for future Scalatra 3.0.0 in order to improve future maintainability.

Thanks to all committers and contributors!
