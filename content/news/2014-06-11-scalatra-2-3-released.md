The Scalatra team is pleased to announce the release of Scalatra 2.3.0.

<!--more-->

### Core

* Breaking: Scalatra 2.3.x drops support for Scala 2.9.
* Breaking: Require java 7
* Breaking: if you have custom route transformer hooks the function now needs a param type

Before:

```
protected def swaggerMeta(s: Symbol, v: Any): RouteTransformer = { route ⇒
    route.copy(metadata = route.metadata + (s -> v))
}
```

Now:

```
protected def swaggerMeta(s: Symbol, v: Any): RouteTransformer = { (route: Route) ⇒
    route.copy(metadata = route.metadata + (s -> v))
}
```
