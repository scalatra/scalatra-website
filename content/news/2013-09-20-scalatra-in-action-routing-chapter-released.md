Our book [Scalatra in Action](http://www.manning.com/carrero2/), available from
Manning Publications, has been steadily ticking along over the summer.  
A new chapter, on RESTful application development using Scalatra's routing
DSL, is now available.

<!--more-->


This chapter gives you an overview of both how to tie URLs to your Scalatra
routes, and also *why* you'd want to structure your application routes to
use HTTP to its best advantage, using RESTful conventions.

Chapter 4, "Working with user input", is currently awaiting incorporation in
the next MEAP update for the book and will be available soon.
