## The basics

We've documented most aspects of working with Scalatra in a series of guides covering common development tasks.

		<h3>Routes &amp; actions</h3>
		<p>Scalatra is a MVC micro-framework.  The <emphasis>controller</emphasis> part is handled by a routing DSL based on Sinatra's, although you can also use Rails-style routing conventions if you want to. The <a href="routes-and-actions.html">routes &amp; actions</a> guide shows you how to tie HTTP url paths to code you want to run on the server.</p><p><a href="routes-and-actions.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Views</h3>
		<p>You can easily add templating capabilities to your application so that you can render templates, layouts, and partials. This guide provides an introduction to Scalatra's default templating system, Scalate.</p><p><a href="views.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Helpers</h3>
		<p>Scalatra includes several dozen helper integrations so that you can easily accomplish common development tasks. This guide shows you how to select and add helper traits to your application, for things like Flash map integration, session handling, redirects, getting access to the request, and cross-origin resource sharing.</p><p><a href="helpers.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Models</h3>
		<p>Most applications need to save and retrieve data. Scalatra allows you to use whatever persistence library suits your needs. This guide provides example integrations for some of the most common SQL and MongoDB persistence libraries.</p><p><a href="models.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>Automated tests are essential if you want to ensure your application's correctness and refactor without fear. This guide shows you how to use some of the more common Scala testing libraries alongside Scalatra.</p><p><a href="testing.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>

	<div class="span4">
		<h3>Configuration &amp; deployment</h3>
		<p>In order to get your application into production, you'll need to understand how to set startup parameters, run initialization code, and deploy to an application server.</p><p><a href="configuration-deployment.html" class="btn">View »</a> </p>
