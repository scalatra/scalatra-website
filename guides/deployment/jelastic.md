  <h1>Deploying to Jelastic</h1>
</div>

[Jelastic](http://jelastic.com/) is a cloud application platform designed specifically
for servlets like Scalatra apps.
Jelastic allows you to scale your app both horizontally (more instances) and vertically
(more powerful instances).
They offer a 2-week free trial, after which point their rates are among the best in the industry.

  for a minimal and standalone project containing the example in this guide.

## 1. [Register](http://jelastic.com/) for an account.
Jelastic is a platform with many hosts to choose from.
**In this guide we'll assume you've chosen ServInt as your host.**

## 2. Create an environment.
An "environment" in Jelastic-speak is a selection of a servlet container and any add-ons
(like databases) that you may want.
On your [management console](https://app.jelastic.servint.net/) click
"Create environment."

<a href="jelastic-screenshot.png"><img width="500" src="jelastic-screenshot.png" /></a>

You need to choose an environment name that is unique across the entire ServInt host.
**We'll proceed with the environment name `scalatra-test`, but yours will necessarily be
different.**
The default of Tomcat 7 automatically scaling between 1 and 8 cloudlets is fine for us.

## 3. Set up a project.

- Create a Scalatra project from the usual Scalatra giter8 template.
Check out the the [installation]({{site.baseurl}}getting-started/installation.html) and [first project]({{site.baseurl}}getting-started/first-project.html) guides if this isn't familiar.

```sh
$ g8 scalatra/scalatra-sbt -b develop
$ cd [app root]
$ chmod u+x sbt
```

- Install the Jelastic deployment plugin

Add the following line to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.casualjim" % "sbt-jelastic-deploy" % "0.1.2")
```

- Configure the Jelastic deployment plugin

Add the following lines to `buid.sbt`.
You will need to replace `"scalatra-test"` with the name of your environment.

```scala
seq(jelasticSettings:_*)

JelasticKeys.email in JelasticKeys.deploy := sys.env.get("JELASTIC_USERNAME").getOrElse(
sys error "Please export JELASTIC_USERNAME in your shell!"
)

JelasticKeys.password in JelasticKeys.deploy := sys.env.get("JELASTIC_PWD").getOrElse(
sys error "Please export JELASTIC_PWD in your shell!"
)

JelasticKeys.apiHoster := "app.jelastic.servint.net"

JelasticKeys.environment in JelasticKeys.deploy := "scalatra-test"

publishTo := None
```

## 4. Configure your environment
You weren't thinking of storing your username and password in version control, were you?

Open `~/.bash_profile` on Mac, or `~/.bashrc` on Linux, and add these lines,
substituting your Jelastic username and password as appropriate:

```
export JELASTIC_USERNAME="you@you.com"
export JELASTIC_PWD="iluvyou"
```

Now close your shell and open a new one.

## 6. Deploy
With the project set up, your first deploy, and all future deploys, are insanely easy:

```sh
$ cd [app root]
$ ./sbt
> deploy 
```

If all has gone well you'll a ton of output.
Here's an abbreviated example:

## 7. Visit your website

Since we used the environment `scalatra-test`, the app is now live at [http://scalatra-test.jelastic.servint.net](http://scalatra-test.jelastic.servint.net).
As always, you will have to substitute your environment name into that URL.
