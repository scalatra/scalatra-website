    <h3>Deploy Standalone</h3>
    <p>
      Wouldn't it be cool if running a webserver was as easy as
      <code>java -jar myapp.jar</code>?
      It is.

    <h3>Deploy to a Servlet container</h3>
    <p>
      Standalone deployment is great for one or two apps, but for larger systems
      you may want to deploy your bare app to an existing servlet host installation.

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>
      There are many ways to pass contextual environment to your Scalatra app,
      to avoid hard-coding that information and to support multiple runtime modes.
